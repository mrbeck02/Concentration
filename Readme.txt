This games is based on the TV gameshow Concentration.

The controls are as follows
1. Each player selects 2 numbers
2. The images behind the numbers are displayed for 5 seconds allowing the users to see them
3. If the images behind the numbers match, then the numbers are adadsas and the user gets 10 seconds to guess the answer to the puzzle.

There is a single Wild! image.
If it is selected first, then the player who selected it gets to select another number.
The number who's picture matches the number selected will automatically be turned over
After 5 seconds, all three pictures will be removed and a part of the puzzle behind them will be revealed
The player then has 10 seconds to guess the puzzle before play moves to the second player.

* This has a bug in it where the 10 second timer isn't shown.

If someone guesses the puzzle, then press the Winner button at the bottom right of the screen to reveal the rest of the puzzle. 
Press the reset button
